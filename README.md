Welcome! This repository is a complete guide to the VEX robotics programming and engineering process developed during my time as the solo programmer, designer, and builder for the 96067 robotics team.
It includes code, tuning methods, and lessons from competition robots such as 96067X, 96067C, and the Skills bot.
