Welcome! This repository is a complete guide to the VEX robotics programming and engineering process developed during my time as the solo programmer for the 96067 robotics team at Essex County Newark Tech.  

The Legacy Programming Guide was created by me to pass down to the next coders of my high school’s robotics teams — a resource so future student programmers can build, compete, and innovate with confidence.  

This repo exists as an add-on to my GitHub portfolio, showcasing my work for resume and professional purposes.
